Community-driven community

This repository contains the PoC-implementation of my masters thesis. It shows that a community can completely manage and evolve themselves without central
authorities. Although the community does use a community treasure to finance the projects they have selected, money does have no weight in the decisions,
id est members can not use money to gain more influence. In future development, any project that was voted for and realized by the community is maintained
by the community and funded by the system. This means that projects which were realized by the community, are free to use for the community. Whether projects
are kept alive lays completly in the hands of the community. Services that the community has no interest in anymore will eventually die out (although they can
be "revived" at any time if the community decides to do so).
